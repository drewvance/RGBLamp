RGBLamp
=======

Simple way to change the color of a desk lamp from windows.

To use, upload \Arduino\ComandListener.ino to an arduino board. 
Wire up a string of leds to three PWM outputs on the board. I used 9, 10, and 11 for blue, red, and green respectively.

Next run the desktop app and use the sliders to change the RGB values.
